# Calango (aka clng) - A High-Performance User Interface Framework

Calango is a cutting-edge User Interface (UI) framework designed specifically for web development.

Built upon the foundation of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Material Design](https://material.io/), Calango combines the best of both worlds to offer developers a powerful and versatile toolset.

This project aims to deliver a framework that excels in performance, adheres to responsive design principles, and meets Google Lighthouse's requirements. By leveraging the power of Gulp, Sass, HTML, and JavaScript, Calango empowers developers to create stunning and efficient web interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Performance Optimization:** Calango places a strong emphasis on optimizing performance to provide developers with lightning-fast load times. The framework streamlines code and utilizes advanced optimization techniques to minimize page load and render times. By reducing unnecessary network requests and optimizing asset delivery through the technique of [tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking); defined through Gulp tasks; Calango ensures a seamless user experience.

- **Bootstrap and Material Design Integration:** Calango leverages the power and familiarity of both Bootstrap and Material Design frameworks. It is inspired by the responsive grid system and extensive component library of Bootstrap and Material Design. This integration allows developers to create visually appealing and functional web interfaces effortlessly.

- **Gulp Automation:** The framework harnesses the capabilities of [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), a popular task runner, to automate repetitive development tasks. Gulp streamlines processes such as Sass compilation, JavaScript minification, and file concatenation, allowing developers to focus on writing clean and maintainable code. Gulp's automation ensures a more efficient development workflow and enhances overall productivity.

- **Sass Styling:** Calango utilizes [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) to provide a robust and flexible styling system. Sass offers a wide range of features such as variables, mixins, and nested rules, enabling developers to write reusable and modular CSS code. This approach enhances code maintainability and speeds up the styling process.

- **Responsive Design Principles:** Calango is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that web interfaces created using the framework adapt seamlessly to small, medium, and large screen sizes and devices. The responsive grid system, coupled with responsive components, allows developers to build interfaces that are visually consistent and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

- **Accessibility Compliance:** Calango is committed to meeting [Google Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)'s requirements. The framework incorporates accessibility best practices, making it easier for developers to create interfaces that are usable by individuals with disabilities. Calango ensures that proper HTML markup and [ARIA](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/aria-html/) attributes are implemented to deliver an inclusive user experience.

## Conclusion

Calango is a powerful and performance-driven User Interface Framework that combines the strengths of Bootstrap and Material Design.

By leveraging the capabilities of Gulp, Sass, HTML, and JavaScript, Calango empowers developers to create highly efficient and visually appealing web interfaces.

With its focus on faster load times, adherence to responsive design principles, and meeting Google Lighthouse's requirements, Calango provides developers with a comprehensive toolset for building exceptional web applications.
